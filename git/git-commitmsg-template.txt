# Generate a commit message based on the staged changes. 
# Use conventional commit format: type(scope): description
# Use imperative mood: 'Add feature' not 'Added feature'
# Keep entire commit message under 80 characters
# Use types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, chore, ci
# Include scope when relevant (e.g., api, ui, auth)
